# Firefox Voice

Firefox Voice is an experiment from [Mozilla Research](https://research.mozilla.org/).

Firefox Voice is a browser extension that allows you to give voice commands to your browser, such as "what is the weather?" or "find the gmail tab". Ultimately the goal is to see if we can facilitate meaningful user interactions with the web using just voice-based interactions. Initially the goal is to provide _any_ useful interactions.

## Developing

There is some documentation in the [docs/](./docs/) directory, notably [writing an intent](./docs/writing-an-intent.md).

If you are using Windows, please install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), as the installation won't work from a normal Windows command prompt.

The developer installation is:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

This will launch a new Firefox browser with the extension installed. You should probably have [Nightly or Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/) installed.

By default this will use Firefox Nightly, but you can override this with the environmental variable `$FIREFOX` (you can point it to a release version, but some things may not work; also you can use a localized Firefox or an unbranded Firefox). You can also set `$PROFILE` to a directory where the profile information is kept (it defaults to `./Profile/`).

By default messaging-related logging messages aren't shown, you can turn logging up slightly with `$LOG_LEVEL=messaging` (or like `LOG_LEVEL=messaging npm start`).

## Using in-development versions

It's possible to install and use in-development versions of the extension. Every commit to `master` is built into the dev build, and when we prepare for a release and merge to `stage` is used to create the stage build.

**NOTE THAT THESE VERSIONS INCLUDE EXTRA DATA COLLECTION**

We are using these builds for internal testing with more-than-normal data collection. We have not yet implemented data collection controls.

- [Install dev version](https://va.allizom.org/releases/dev/firefox-voice.xpi)
- [Install stage version](https://va.allizom.org/releases/stage/firefox-voice.xpi)
- [Install production version](https://va.allizom.org/releases/prod/firefox-voice.xpi)
- [Logs of updates](https://va.allizom.org/releases/public-update-log.txt)

The version numbers are increased for each release and each commit, but are _not_ sequential.

### Viewing Intent Information

There is an index of intents (commands) that is viewable if you open the panel, click on the gear/settings, and follow the "Intent Viewer" link.
