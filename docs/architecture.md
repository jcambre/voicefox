# Firefox Voice architecture

As of April 28th 2020, this is a description of how Firefox Voice works and is laid out.

## Large components

There's a couple different things in the repository. Most of this document is about the Firefox Voice extension.

### Firefox Voice extension

The extension is a WebExtension written for Firefox. The code is all in `extension/`

It can potentially be run in mobile Firefox, but a lot of it doesn't make sense or isn't fully functional. Technically while many APIs exist, background tabs, popups, getUserMedia, and other details make the experience hard to translate.

### Android application

There is an Android application, written in Kotlin, in `android-app/`.

This application acts as a replacement for the system assistant on Android phones.

## Homepage

The public homepage is in `homepage/` and has its own `package.json` and `npm run ...` commands.

It produces static files that are written to the `gh-pages` branch, which publishes them to https://mozilla.github.io/firefox-voice/homepage/

The "real" public URL is https://voice.mozilla.org/firefox-voice/ which simply proxies the github.io pages.

# The extension

## Build & dependencies

`package.json` contains most of our dependencies, though everything is built statically into `extension/`. The live product doesn't use Node at all, but we do make the distinction that the `dependencies` section contains code that is copied into the extension, while `devDependencies` is for libraries we use in development, building, and packaging.

Scripts in `bin/` are all for the purpose of building, but most of them are run with `npm run`, which may also setup environmental variables, or run appropriate dependencies before the script.

`.jsx` files are generally build into a `.js` file directly alongside the jsx file, and we ignore the original .js file with `.gitignore`

### Code conventions

## Extension processes

The extension has a couple separate "processes" (different pages, or runtime environments):

- The background page (starting in `extension/background/main.js`) runs the show. It is responsible for starting things up, doing basic lifecycle operations, any canonical information storage, and managing the actual intent system.
- The popup (starting in `extension/popup/popupController.jsx`) is another page that manages the microphone and user input. When launched it almost always listens immediately for input (an exception is when opened for a timer). It mostly doesn't _do_ things, but asks the background page to do things, and the background page asks the popup to display things.
- The wakeword page (starting in `extension/wakeword/wakewordController.jsx`) runs in its own tab and listens for the wakeword. For the wakeword the microphone is always open, and the tab must be open to listen. Note this is not currently functional.
- The recorder page (starting in `extension/recorder/recorder.js`) is a largely-deprecated feature where a tab would stay open to listen to the microphone, due to problems using the microphone in the popup. This tab acts like a shim. In the most recent versions of Firefox it is not necessary.
- Content scripts. When an intent has to interact directly with a page, a content script is injected into that page. These are a variety of scripts in `extension/intents/*/*.js` (there is no specific pattern for naming them). There are support scripts for content scripts in `extension/content/`
- Miscellaneous content pages, such as options (`extension/options`), onboarding (`extension/onboarding`) and a couple pages in `extension/views/`
- The "WebExtension experiments", which are high-privileged pieces of code that run in Firefox's main process (in `extension/experiments/voice/`).

### Communication

Communication is primary done using [browser.runtime.sendMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/sendMessage) and [browser.runtime.onMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/runtime/onMessage).

Messages that are sent to a content script are send directly to only that tab using [browser.tabs.sendMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/sendMessage) but all other messages are send "globally". So a message from the background page to the popup may also be received by an options page. To manage these we return `null` in contexts where the message is not understood and not handled, and only return a value (as a Promise) when it is properly handled in an onMessage listener.

Messages are always JSON objects, and always have a `.type` property, such as `{type: "getExamples"}`.

Most of the background messages are handled in `main.js` (which calls out to any other modules that are needed). The `*Controller.jsx` scripts typically handle their own messages.
